# Customer_Attrition_Prediction

Churn Prediction Project Overview:

Churn prediction is a crucial application in the field of machine learning, particularly in the context of customer-centric industries. The term "churn" refers to customers leaving a company, and understanding the reasons and timing behind customer churn is essential for businesses to retain their customer base. Developing an accurate churn prediction model empowers businesses to proactively address potential churn scenarios and take preventive actions.

Dataset:
For this project, we leverage the "Verizonet telecommunication Customer" dataset. The dataset comprises information on 7,043 customers, with 42  features (independent variables) and 1 target variable (dependent variable). The target variable indicates whether a customer has recently left the company (churn=yes) within the last month. Given that the target variable is binary (yes/no or 1/0), this project is framed as a binary classification problem.

Objective:
The primary objective is to build a robust and accurate machine learning model that predicts customer churn. By analyzing the 42 independent variables, the model aims to classify customers into the categories of churned or not churned, facilitating proactive measures to retain customers and mitigate business losses.

This project involves various stages such as data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation and feature importance analysis. The success of the model will be measured by its ability to accurately predict customer churn, providing actionable insights for business decision-making.
